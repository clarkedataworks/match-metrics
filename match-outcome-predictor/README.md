# Match Outcome Predictor âš½ðŸ¤–

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project builds a simple machine learning model to predict football match results (Win, Draw, Loss) using historical match statistics.

The aim is to explore how data such as possession, shots on target, and xG can be used to forecast outcomes.
